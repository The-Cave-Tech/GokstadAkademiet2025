# TheCaveTech

## Plattformen er en universell applikasjon der brukere kan vise frem interesser, arbeider og selge produkter. Alt innhold håndteres enkelt via Strapi-adminpanelet og oppsett av custom admin panel for et mer personlig panel alternativ.

The Cave Tech bruker denne platformen for å vise sine prosjekter til sine bekjente, arrangere arrangementer som kollegaer kan delta på, og butikken for å selge lokalt produserte produkter. Internt kan man legge ut blogger for å beskrive mer følelser og hverdagslige ting til hverandre, og brukeren kan skrive blogg poster som admin kan godkjenne eller avkrefte.

Administratorer har full kontroll i Strapi og kan administrere prosjekter, arrangementer, blogginnlegg og brukerinformasjon. Autentisering skjer via lokal eller tredjeparts pålogging. Vanlige brukere kan også bidra med blogginnlegg.

Plattformen mangler full CRM, men alle kontaktmeldinger og brukerdata lagres i db og er tilgjengelig i strapi admin panel. Kjøpshistorikk er delvis implementert.

1. Installation
</strong></summary>

</br>
Both frontend and backend have `.env.example` files.  
0. Create `.env` files in both frontend and backend folders and copy the contents from `.env.example` into `.env`.


# The database file contains only data, not images.

# <strong>Backend:</strong>  
1. In the project root, you'll find a zipped database file.  
     Unzip it.  
2. Start MySQL Workbench  
3. Go to your root connection in Workbench → Administration → Users and Privileges → Add Account →  
     Enter `DATABASE_USERNAME` and `DATABASE_PASSWORD` as specified in your backend `.env` file  
4. In Administrative Roles, select all and click Apply  
5. Go to MySQL Connections and create a connection with the username from step 3  
6. Enter the connection you just created  
7. From the menu, select Server → Data Import

9. For "Default Schema to be Imported To", choose "New" and enter `DATABASE_NAME` as in your `.env`  
10. Select the schema from "Default Target Schema" and click Start Import  
11. Refresh Schemas, and in Query, write `USE "database_name_from_env"` (e.g., `USE thecavetech`)

# <strong>Frontend:</strong>  
Here, you just need to copy the contents from .env.example into .env.

After setting up `.env` in the root folder (where `.env.example` is):

**Run:**

#Backend
In your terminal:  
12. `cd backend`  
13. `npm i`  
14. `npm run develop`
14. Navigate to the backend URL specified in your frontend `.env`  
15. If using our database file and prompted to create a user, use:  
        - Email: test@den.no  
        - Password: Gokstad1234  
     # OR 
     admin@admin.no </br>
     Admin1234 </br>

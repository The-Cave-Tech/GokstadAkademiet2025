# TheCaveTech

## Plattformen er en modul√¶r applikasjon best√•ende av en backend del bygget i Strapi p√• toppen av mySQL med et frontend brukergrenssnitt hvor brukere av denne kan vise frem prosjektportef√∏ljen, arrangementer og ha muligheten til √• selge produkter. I tillegg til nettsiden finnes det en CRM funksjon hvor medlemmer av organisasjonen kan lage en profil og f√• tilgang til en del av de modul√¶re funksjonene. </br> </br > Applikasjonen h√•ndteres enkelt via Strapi-administratorpanelet og her finnes det tilpasningsmuligheter for et mer personlig preg. I tilegg til et eget rollebasert panel med valgmuligheter for tiln√¶rming hvis man vil bruke det instedenfor Strapi sitt panel. Platformen er designet og bygget p√• en generisk m√•te slik at andre makerspace kan ta dette i bruk.

The Cave Tech bruker denne platformen for √• vise sine prosjekter og produkter til sine interessenter. De kan lage arrangementer som medlemmer og andre interessenter kan melde seg p√• og delta i. Det er lagt til rette for en nettbutikken for √• kunne selge egne produkter for √• kunne f√• en ekstra inntektskilde til organisasjonen. Det er bloggfunksjon for √• beskrive p√•g√•ende prosjekter og dele faglig innhold. Her kan brukeren skrive bloggposter som admin kan godkjenne eller avkrefte.

Rolletilgang:

Administratorer har full kontroll i Strapi og kan administrere prosjekter, arrangementer, blogginnlegg og brukerinformasjon. Autentisering skjer via lokal eller tredjeparts p√•logging. Vanlige brukere kan ogs√• bidra med blogginnlegg.

Status:

Plattformen mangler full CRM, men alle kontaktmeldinger og brukerdata lagres i db og er tilgjengelig i strapi admin panel. Kj√∏pshistorikk er delvis implementert. I eget panel mangler arkiveringsfunksjonalitet og bruken av WYSIWYG editor opp mot Strapi p√• grunn av format forskjeller (holder p√• √• bli fikset)

    <summary><strong>Universal components</strong></summary>
<details>
    <summary>üìá ContentCard</summary>

The `ContentCard` is a universal card component used throughout the application to display different types of content‚Äîsuch as projects, events, blogs, and products‚Äîin a consistent and visually appealing way.

#### How it works

- The same `ContentCard` component is used for all content types.
- An **adapter** (for example, `cardAdapter`) transforms the data for each content type (project, event, blog, product) into a format that the `ContentCard` understands.
- This makes it easy to add new content types or update the card design in one place, and have the changes reflected everywhere.

#### Example usages

**Displaying a list of projects:**

```tsx
import { UniversalCard } from "@/components/pageSpecificComponents/dashboard/contentManager/ContentCard";
import { adaptProjectToCardProps } from "@/lib/adapters/cardAdapter";

// Inside your component render:
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  {projects.map((project) => (
    <UniversalCard
      key={project.id}
      {...adaptProjectToCardProps(project, handleProjectClick)}
    />
  ))}
</div>;
```

**Displaying a list of events:**

```tsx
import { UniversalCard } from "@/components/pageSpecificComponents/dashboard/contentManager/ContentCard";
import { adaptEventToCardProps } from "@/lib/adapters/cardAdapter";

// Inside your component render:
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  {events.map((event) => (
    <UniversalCard
      key={event.id}
      {...adaptEventToCardProps(event, handleEventClick)}
    />
  ))}
</div>;
```

</details>
<details>
    <summary>üîé SearchBar</summary>

The `SearchBar` is a universal component used throughout the application to help users quickly find relevant content, such as projects, events, blogs, or products. It provides a simple and consistent search experience on all pages where searching is needed. This can also easily change your search logic since now it's mostly really basic searching.

#### How it works

- The `SearchBar` displays a text input where users can type their search query.
- As the user types, the search query is updated in real time.
- Optionally, a search button can be shown for submitting the search (for example, by pressing Enter or clicking the button).
- The component is flexible and can be used for any type of content by simply passing the current search query and a function to update it.

#### Example usage

**Using the SearchBar in a page or component:**

```tsx
import { SearchBar } from "@/components/ui/SearchBar";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function ExamplePage() {
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");

  // Optional: handle search submit
  const handleSearch = (query: string) => {
    // Perform search logic here
    console.log("Searching for:", query);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <SearchBar
        searchQuery={searchQuery}
        setSearchQuery={setSearchQuery}
        placeholder="Search projects or events"
        onSearch={handleSearch}
      />
      {/* Render your filtered content here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

</details>
<details>
    <summary>üîÄ SortDropdown</summary>

The `SortDropdown` is a universal component that lets users easily sort lists of content, such as projects, events, blogs, or products. It provides a consistent and user-friendly way to choose how items are ordered on any page.

#### How it works

- The `SortDropdown` displays a dropdown menu with different sorting options (for example: newest first, oldest first, alphabetical).
- When the user selects an option, the list updates to show the content in the chosen order.
- The component is flexible and can be used for any type of content by passing in the available sort options and a function to update the sort state.

#### Example usage

**Using the SortDropdown in a page or component:**

```tsx
import { SortDropdown } from "@/components/ui/SortDropdown";
import { useState } from "react";

const sortOptions = [
  { value: "newest", label: "Newest first" },
  { value: "oldest", label: "Oldest first" },
  { value: "az", label: "A-Z" },
  { value: "za", label: "Z-A" },
];

export default function ExamplePage() {
  const [sort, setSort] = useState("newest");

  return (
    <div>
      <SortDropdown
        sort={sort}
        setSort={setSort}
        options={sortOptions}
        placeholder="Sort by"
      />
      {/* Render your sorted content here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

</details>
<details>
    <summary>‚Üª LoadingSpinner</summary>

The `LoadingSpinner` is a universal component that shows a spinning animation while the app is loading data. It helps users understand that something is happening in the background and improves the user experience by providing visual feedback.

#### How it works

- The `LoadingSpinner` displays a spinning circle to indicate that content is loading.
- You can choose different sizes (small, medium, large) to fit different parts of your app.
- The spinner can be reused anywhere you need to show a loading state, such as when fetching projects, events, or blog posts.

#### Example usage

**Using the LoadingSpinner in a page or component:**

```tsx
import { LoadingSpinner } from "@/components/ui/LoadingSpinner";

export default function ExamplePage({ isLoading }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? (
        <LoadingSpinner size="medium" />
      ) : (
        <div>Your loaded content here</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

</details>
<details>
    <summary>Card</summary>

The `Card` component is a universal building block used throughout the application to display content in a clean, organized, and visually appealing way. It provides a consistent layout for different types of information, such as projects, events, blogs, or products.

#### How it works

- The `Card` component wraps content in a styled box with rounded corners and a shadow, making information easy to read and visually separated from other elements.
- It can be combined with `CardHeader`, `CardBody`, and `CardFooter` subcomponents to organize content into sections (for example: image at the top, details in the middle, actions at the bottom).
- The card is flexible and can be used for any type of content by simply placing your content inside the card sections.

#### Example usage

**Using the Card component in a page or component:**

```tsx
import { Card, CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter } from "@/components/ui/Card";

export default function ExamplePage() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <h3>Project Title</h3>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        <p>This is a short description of the project or content.</p>
      </CardBody>
      <CardFooter>
        <button>Read more</button>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

</details>
**Why use universal components?**

- **Saves time** - Makes you only build and update one feature, and it will work everywhere in the application where needed.
- **Consistent look** - The application as a whole will have a much full and clean look to it by using universal components. This helps for easier user flow and understandability for users.
- **Easy to maintain** - If the application needs to change something in the code, you only need to change in one place. Removes all grunt work needed to maintainabilty by redoing changes everywhere when they do the same.
- **Flexibility** - You can easy flex your application for when you need to add new content. This means you will only need to add without having to rewrite alot of extra code.
- **Scalability** - It makes everything in the code organized. This helps when the project starts growing with more features that needs to be added.
